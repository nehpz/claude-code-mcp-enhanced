# Task 006: Properly Formatted Task ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Test the task converter with a properly formatted task.

**Requirements**:
1. Include all required sections
2. Follow formatting conventions
3. Include execution modes and dependencies

## Overview

This task is specifically formatted to test the task converter. It includes all required sections and follows the conventions in the template guide.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 4 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Task execution systems commonly offer both sequential and parallel execution modes to handle different types of workflow dependencies.

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Current best practices (2024-2025)
   - Production implementation patterns  
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Performance optimization techniques

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repositories with working code
   - Real production examples
   - Popular library implementations
   - Benchmark comparisons

3. **Document all findings** in task reports:
   - Links to source repositories
   - Code snippets that work
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration patterns

4. **DO NOT proceed without research**:
   - No theoretical implementations
   - No guessing at patterns
   - Must have real code examples
   - Must verify current best practices

Example Research Queries:
```

WebSearch: "site:github.com asyncio task executor implementation"
```

**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL
**Dependencies**: ["Task 1", "Task 2"]

**Description**: Test a mixed execution flow with both sequential and parallel components.

**Implementation Steps**:

  - Include performance metrics
  - Verify correctness
  - Note any limitations

### Task 4: Completion Verification and Iteration ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Complexity**: LOW | **Impact**: CRITICAL

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 4.1 Review all task reports
  - Read all reports in `/docs/reports/006_task_*`
  - Create checklist of incomplete features
  - Identify failed tests or missing functionality
  - Document specific issues preventing completion
  - Prioritize fixes by impact

- [ ] 4.2 Create task completion matrix
  - Build comprehensive status table
  - Mark each sub-task as COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE
  - List specific failures for incomplete tasks
  - Identify blocking dependencies
  - Calculate overall completion percentage

- [ ] 4.3 Iterate on incomplete tasks
  - Return to first incomplete task
  - Fix identified issues
  - Re-run validation tests
  - Update verification report
  - Continue until task passes

- [ ] 4.4 Re-validate completed tasks
  - Ensure no regressions from fixes
  - Run integration tests
  - Verify cross-task compatibility
  - Update affected reports
  - Document any new limitations

- [ ] 4.5 Final comprehensive validation
  - Execute tasks in both modes
  - Test status monitoring
  - Test error handling
  - Verify documentation accuracy
  - Confirm all features work together

- [ ] 4.6 Create final summary report
  - Create `/docs/reports/006_final_summary.md`
  - Include completion matrix
  - Document all working features
  - List any remaining limitations
  - Provide usage recommendations

- [ ] 4.7 Mark task complete only if ALL sub-tasks pass
  - Verify 100% task completion
  - Confirm all reports show success
  - Ensure no critical issues remain
  - Get final approval
  - Update task status to ✅ Complete

**Technical Specifications**:
- Zero tolerance for incomplete features
- Mandatory iteration until completion
- All tests must pass
- All reports must verify success
- No theoretical completions allowed

**Verification Method**:
- Task completion matrix showing 100%
- All reports confirming success
- Rich table with final status

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ALL tasks marked COMPLETE
- ALL verification reports show success
- ALL tests pass without issues
- ALL features work in production
- NO incomplete functionality

**CRITICAL ITERATION REQUIREMENT**:
This task CANNOT be marked complete until ALL previous tasks are verified as COMPLETE with passing tests and working functionality. The agent MUST continue iterating on incomplete tasks until 100% completion is achieved.

## Usage Table
