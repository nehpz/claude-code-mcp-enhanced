# Task: Mixed Execution Flow ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Demonstrate a mixed sequential and parallel execution flow.

**Requirements**:
1. Execute tasks in a specific order with mixed execution modes
2. Show dependencies between tasks
3. Demonstrate how to combine sequential and parallel execution
4. Provide visualization of the execution flow

## Overview

This task demonstrates how to implement a complex execution flow where some tasks run sequentially and others run in parallel.
It follows this pattern:
- Task 1 runs first (sequential)
- When Task 1 completes, Tasks 2 and 3 run concurrently (parallel)
- When Tasks 2 and 3 complete, Task 4 runs (sequential)
- Task 5 runs only after Task 4 completes (sequential)

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Initialize Project ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW | **Impact**: HIGH
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 1.1 Create project directory
  - Create `/tmp/mixed_flow` directory
  - Set appropriate permissions

- [ ] 1.2 Create configuration files
  - Create `config.json` with project settings
  - Initialize logging system

- [ ] 1.3 Verify initialization
  - Check that directory exists
  - Validate configuration file

### Task 2: Process Data Set A ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM
**Execution Mode**: PARALLEL (with Task 3)
**Dependencies**: Task 1

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 2.1 Generate sample data A
  - Create 5 data files for set A
  - Each file should have numerical data

- [ ] 2.2 Process set A
  - Apply transformation algorithm to each file
  - Record processing results

### Task 3: Process Data Set B ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: MEDIUM
**Execution Mode**: PARALLEL (with Task 2)
**Dependencies**: Task 1

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 3.1 Generate sample data B
  - Create 5 data files for set B
  - Each file should have textual data

- [ ] 3.2 Process set B
  - Apply text analysis to each file
  - Record processing results

### Task 4: Combine Results ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: HIGH
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL
**Dependencies**: Task 2, Task 3

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 4.1 Collect all results
  - Read output from data set A processing
  - Read output from data set B processing

- [ ] 4.2 Merge results
  - Combine results from both data sets
  - Create a unified data structure

### Task 5: Generate Final Report ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: LOW | **Impact**: HIGH
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL
**Dependencies**: Task 4

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 5.1 Format combined results
  - Create human-readable format
  - Add visualizations if needed

- [ ] 5.2 Generate final report
  - Create PDF or HTML report
  - Include summary and detailed sections

## Task Dependencies and Execution Modes

This example demonstrates how task dependencies and execution modes work together:

| Task ID | Description | Dependencies | Execution Mode |
|---------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Task 1  | Initialize Project | None | Sequential |
| Task 2  | Process Data Set A | Task 1 | Parallel (with Task 3) |
| Task 3  | Process Data Set B | Task 1 | Parallel (with Task 2) |
| Task 4  | Combine Results | Task 2, Task 3 | Sequential |
| Task 5  | Generate Final Report | Task 4 | Sequential |

## Implementation Notes

The orchestration system should:

1. Start with Task 1 (sequential)
2. After Task 1 completes, start Tasks 2 and 3 concurrently (parallel)
3. After both Tasks 2 and 3 complete, start Task 4 (sequential)
4. After Task 4 completes, start Task 5 (sequential)

## Expected Task Execution Timeline

```
Time ----->

Task 1: [==========]
Task 2:            [===========]
Task 3:            [============]
Task 4:                         [========]
Task 5:                                   [=====]
```

## Usage

```bash
# Execute the mixed flow task
python -m claude_code_mcp.cli execute-task mixed-flow
```

## Expected Output

```
=== Mixed Execution Flow Results ===

Task 1: Initialization Complete (3.2s)
  - Created project directory
  - Initialized configuration

Task 2: Data Set A Processing Complete (5.1s)
  - Processed 5 files
  - Average processing time: 1.02s per file

Task 3: Data Set B Processing Complete (4.8s)
  - Processed 5 files
  - Average processing time: 0.96s per file

Task 4: Results Combination Complete (2.5s)
  - Combined 10 result sets
  - Created unified data structure

Task 5: Report Generation Complete (1.8s)
