# Task 004: Task Execution Modes (Sequential and Parallel) ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Implement task execution modes (sequential and parallel) to allow users to specify how subtasks should be executed within a task.

**Requirements**:
1. Add support for specifying execution mode in task data
2. Implement sequential execution for subtasks
3. Implement parallel execution for subtasks
4. Add MCP endpoints for task execution and status monitoring
5. Create documentation and examples for using execution modes

## Overview

This task enhances the Claude Code MCP server with task execution capabilities, allowing users to choose between sequential and parallel execution modes for subtasks. This provides flexibility for different types of workflows and can improve performance for independent tasks.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 4 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Task execution systems commonly offer both sequential and parallel execution modes to handle different types of workflow dependencies. Sequential execution ensures ordered processing and is suitable for tasks with dependencies, while parallel execution improves performance for independent tasks.

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Current best practices (2024-2025)
   - Production implementation patterns  
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Performance optimization techniques

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repositories with working code
   - Real production examples
   - Popular library implementations
   - Benchmark comparisons

3. **Document all findings** in task reports:
   - Links to source repositories
   - Code snippets that work
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration patterns

4. **DO NOT proceed without research**:
   - No theoretical implementations
   - No guessing at patterns
   - Must have real code examples
   - Must verify current best practices

```

WebSearch: "site:github.com asyncio task executor implementation"
```

## Implementation Tasks (Ordered by Priority/Complexity)

### Task 1: Answer Simple Geography Questions ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW | **Impact**: HIGH

**Description**: This task will implement a sequential execution mode to answer a series of simple geography questions.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 1.1 Create a task that answers "What is the capital of France?" using sequential execution mode
- [ ] 1.2 Capture and log the results of the task
- [ ] 1.3 Measure execution time
- [ ] 1.4 Create verification report with results and metrics

**Verification Method**:
- Task must return "Paris" as the answer
- Execution must follow sequential mode constraints
- Response time must be recorded

### Task 2: Generate Python Functions ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: HIGH

**Description**: This task will implement parallel execution mode to generate multiple Python functions simultaneously.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 2.1 Create a task that writes "Write a Python function that multiplies two numbers" using parallel execution mode
- [ ] 2.2 Add a second function request for "Write a Python function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list"
- [ ] 2.3 Capture and log the results of both tasks
- [ ] 2.4 Measure execution time and compare with sequential execution
- [ ] 2.5 Create verification report with results and performance comparison

**Verification Method**:
- Both functions must be valid Python code
- Execution must follow parallel mode constraints
- Performance benefit must be documented
- Functions must work when tested

### Task 3: Apple Color Question ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: LOW | **Impact**: MEDIUM

**Description**: This task will ask a simple question about the most common color of an apple using sequential execution mode.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 3.1 Create a task that answers "What is the most common color of an apple?" using sequential execution mode
- [ ] 3.2 Capture and log the result
- [ ] 3.3 Measure execution time
- [ ] 3.4 Create verification report with results and metrics

**Verification Method**:
- Task must return "Red" or a similar valid answer
- Execution must follow sequential mode constraints
- Response time must be recorded

### Task 4: Mixed Mode Task Execution ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: HIGH | **Impact**: HIGH

**Description**: This task will implement a mixed execution flow with both sequential and parallel tasks.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 4.1 Create a task with 5 subtasks:
  - Sequential: "Generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100"
  - Parallel: "Calculate the sum of the numbers"
  - Parallel: "Calculate the average of the numbers"
  - Parallel: "Find the maximum value"
  - Sequential: "Create a report with all results"
- [ ] 4.2 Implement dependency management between tasks
- [ ] 4.3 Capture execution flow and results
- [ ] 4.4 Measure performance metrics
- [ ] 4.5 Create verification report with results and flow diagram

**Verification Method**:
- All results must be mathematically correct

### Task 5: Tasks with Timeouts ⏳ Not Started

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: HIGH

**Description**: This task will implement timeout handling for tasks.

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] 5.1 Create a simple task that returns "What is 2 + 2?" with a 5-second timeout
- [ ] 5.2 Create a complex task that times out (e.g., "Generate a 10,000-word essay" with a 1-second timeout)
- [ ] 5.3 Implement timeout detection and handling
- [ ] 5.4 Capture timeout events and partial results
- [ ] 5.5 Create verification report with timeout handling metrics

**Verification Method**:
- Quick task must complete successfully
- Long task must time out as expected
- Timeout must be handled gracefully
