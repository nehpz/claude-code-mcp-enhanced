# Task 003: Claude Code MCP Task Orchestration System ó Not Started

**Objective**: Implement a task orchestration system for Claude Code that enables automated multi-step tasks with verification and reporting, leveraging the existing MCP infrastructure.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a Python-based task orchestration framework that integrates with the existing MCP server
2. Develop a task converter that transforms markdown task descriptions into executable JSON format
3. Implement a task executor that handles sub-task sequencing, dependencies, and verification
4. Create a reporting system that documents execution results and verification status
5. Design a proof-of-concept demonstration using real Claude Code MCP functionality

## Overview

This task creates a framework for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks with Claude Code. By breaking down tasks into smaller, verifiable units, we ensure more reliable and consistent AI-assisted workflows with mandatory verification steps.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 5 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Task orchestration systems are essential for reliable automation, especially with AI systems. The approach draws from workflow automation principles, dependency management systems, and verification frameworks to ensure that complex tasks can be broken down, executed reliably, and validated properly.

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Current best practices (2024-2025)
   - Production implementation patterns  
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Performance optimization techniques

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repositories with working code
   - Real production examples
   - Popular library implementations
   - Benchmark comparisons

3. **Document all findings** in task reports:
   - Links to source repositories
   - Code snippets that work
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration patterns

4. **DO NOT proceed without research**:
   - No theoretical implementations
   - No guessing at patterns
   - Must have real code examples
   - Must verify current best practices

Example Research Queries:
```
perplexity_ask: "python task orchestration systems best practices 2024"
WebSearch: "site:github.com task orchestration python framework"
```
