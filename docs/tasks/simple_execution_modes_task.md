# Task 004: Task Execution Modes Demo

## Objective
Demonstrate task execution modes (sequential and parallel) by running simple geography and coding tasks.

## Requirements
1. [ ] Execute Task 1 in sequential mode
2. [ ] Execute Task 2 in parallel mode
3. [ ] Execute Task 3 in sequential mode
4. [ ] Execute Task 4 in mixed mode (sequential and parallel)
5. [ ] Generate verification reports for all tasks

## Task List
- [ ] Validate `geography_sequential`
   - [ ] Answer "What is the capital of France?"
   - [ ] Measure execution time
   - [ ] Create verification report

- [ ] Validate `python_functions_parallel`
   - [ ] Write a Python function that multiplies two numbers
   - [ ] Write a Python function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list
   - [ ] Measure execution time
   - [ ] Compare with sequential execution
   - [ ] Create verification report

- [ ] Validate `apple_color_sequential`
   - [ ] Answer "What is the most common color of an apple?"
   - [ ] Measure execution time
   - [ ] Create verification report

- [ ] Validate `mixed_mode_execution`
   - [ ] Sequential: Generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100
   - [ ] Parallel: Calculate the sum of the numbers
   - [ ] Parallel: Calculate the average of the numbers
   - [ ] Parallel: Find the maximum value
   - [ ] Sequential: Create a report with all results
