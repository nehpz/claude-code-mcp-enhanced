  "objective": "Implement task execution modes (sequential and parallel) to allow users to specify how subtasks should be executed within a task.",
  "requirements": [
    "Add support for specifying execution mode in task data",
    "Implement sequential execution for subtasks",
    "Implement parallel execution for subtasks",
