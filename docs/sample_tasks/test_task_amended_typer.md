# Task 123: Test Task ⏳ Not Started

**Requirements**:
1. [REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT]
2. [REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT]
3. [ADD MORE REQUIREMENTS AS NEEDED]



**Objective**: [REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE]



This is a simple test task to verify the task amender functionality.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: First Subtask ⏳ Not Started
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL

### Task 2: Second Subtask (depends on Task 1) ⏳ Not Started
**Execution Mode**: SEQUENTIAL



## Overview

[REPLACE WITH OVERVIEW OF THE TASK]

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 4 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.



## Usage Table

| Command / Function | Description | Example Usage | Expected Output |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------| 
| `[COMMAND]` | [DESCRIPTION] | `[EXAMPLE COMMAND]` | [EXPECTED OUTPUT] |
| `[COMMAND]` | [DESCRIPTION] | `[EXAMPLE COMMAND]` | [EXPECTED OUTPUT] |



## Version Control Plan

- **Initial Commit**: Create task-[NUMBER]-start tag before implementation
- [ ] **Feature Commits**: After each major feature
- [ ] **Integration Commits**: After component integration  
- [ ] **Test Commits**: After test suite completion
- **Final Tag**: Create task-[NUMBER]-complete after all tests pass

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Start date: TBD
- [ ] Current phase: Planning
- [ ] Expected completion: TBD
- [ ] Completion criteria: All features working, tests passing, documented



## Report Documentation Requirements

Each sub-task MUST have a corresponding verification report in `/docs/reports/` following these requirements:

### Report Structure:
Each report must include:
1. **Task Summary**: Brief description of what was implemented
2. **Research Findings**: Links to repos, code examples found, best practices discovered
3. **Non-Mocked Results**: Real command outputs and performance metrics
4. **Performance Metrics**: Actual benchmarks with real data
5. **Code Examples**: Working code with verified output
6. **Verification Evidence**: Logs or metrics proving functionality
7. **Limitations Found**: Any discovered issues or constraints
8. **External Resources Used**: All GitHub repos, articles, and examples referenced

### Report Naming Convention:
`/docs/reports/123_task_[SUBTASK]_[feature_name].md`
