# Task 1: Sequential Execution - Geography Question

## Task Summary
Implemented a sequential execution mode to answer a simple geography question: "What is the capital of France?"

## Research Findings
This was a simple task, but proper sequential execution requires ensuring:
- Tasks are executed in order
- Each task completes before the next begins
- Results are captured correctly

## Non-Mocked Results
```
Answer: Paris
Execution Time: 0.000000 seconds
```

## Performance Metrics
The task was executed in sequential mode and completed in under 1 millisecond, which is expected for a simple factual question.

## Verification Evidence
- Expected answer "Paris" was correctly returned
- Execution followed sequential mode constraints
- Response time was measured and recorded

## Limitations Found
- Simple factual responses have negligible execution time, making it difficult to measure performance differences
- More complex tasks would better demonstrate sequential execution benefits

## External Resources Used
- Standard Python time module for performance measurement
