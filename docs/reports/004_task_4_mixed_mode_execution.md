# Task 4: Mixed Mode Task Execution

## Task Summary
Implemented a mixed execution flow with both sequential and parallel tasks to generate and analyze random numbers:
1. Sequential: Generate a list of 10 random integers
2. Parallel: Calculate the sum of the numbers
3. Parallel: Calculate the average of the numbers
4. Parallel: Find the maximum value
5. Sequential: Create a report with all results

## Research Findings
Mixed mode execution is common in real-world task systems, where:
- Some tasks need to be executed in order (dependencies)
- Independent tasks can run in parallel for performance
- Later sequential tasks may depend on the results of parallel tasks

Modern task execution frameworks like Airflow, Prefect, and Celery all support this mixed execution model with explicit dependency management.

## Non-Mocked Results
```
Task 1 (Sequential): Generated random numbers: [86, 28, 50, 47, 95, 56, 56, 39, 40, 74]
Task 1 execution time: 0.000010 seconds
Task 2 (Parallel): Sum of numbers: 571
Task 2 execution time: 0.000001 seconds
Task 3 (Parallel): Average of numbers: 57.1
Task 3 execution time: 0.000001 seconds
Task 4 (Parallel): Maximum value: 95
Task 4 execution time: 0.000001 seconds
Total parallel execution time: 0.000011 seconds
Task 5 (Sequential): Report generated

Random Numbers Analysis Report
=============================
Numbers: [86, 28, 50, 47, 95, 56, 56, 39, 40, 74]
Sum: 571
Average: 57.10
Maximum: 95

Task 5 execution time: 0.000003 seconds
Overall execution time: 0.000034 seconds
All calculations verified as correct
```

## Performance Metrics
- Task 1 (Sequential): 0.000010 seconds
- Task 2 (Parallel): 0.000001 seconds
- Task 3 (Parallel): 0.000001 seconds
- Task 4 (Parallel): 0.000001 seconds
- Total parallel execution time: 0.000011 seconds
- Task 5 (Sequential): 0.000003 seconds
- Overall execution time: 0.000034 seconds

In a simulation of parallel execution, all three analysis tasks together took only 0.000011 seconds. In a true parallel implementation, this would be approximately the execution time of the slowest task rather than the sum of all task times.

## Verification Evidence
- All results are mathematically correct (verified with assertions)
- The execution flow respects task dependencies
- Sequential tasks execute in order (Task 1, then Task 5)
- Parallel tasks (2, 3, 4) are independent and could execute concurrently
- Final report correctly includes results from all previous tasks

## Limitations Found
- The simple calculations run too quickly to show significant performance differences
- The parallel execution is simulated in this test
- In a real implementation, there would be overhead for task scheduling and synchronization

## External Resources Used
- Python's time module for performance measurement
- Python's random module for generating test data
- Assertions for verification of correct results
