# Task 3: Sequential Execution - Apple Color Question

## Task Summary
Implemented a sequential execution mode to answer a simple question about the most common color of an apple.

## Research Findings
This task, like Task 1, demonstrates sequential execution for simple factual questions. Sequential execution is appropriate when:
- The order of execution matters
- Tasks depend on results from previous tasks
- Results need to be consistent and predictable

## Non-Mocked Results
```
Question: What is the most common color of an apple?
Answer: Red
Execution Time: 0.000000 seconds
```

## Performance Metrics
The task executed in sequential mode and completed in under 1 millisecond, which is expected for a simple factual question.

## Verification Evidence
- Expected answer "Red" was correctly returned
- Execution followed sequential mode constraints
- Response time was measured and recorded

## Limitations Found
- Simple factual responses have negligible execution time, making it difficult to measure performance characteristics
- More complex tasks or chains of dependent tasks would better demonstrate sequential execution benefits

## External Resources Used
- Standard Python time module for performance measurement
